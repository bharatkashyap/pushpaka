## Minutes

1. Meeting in the ministry about how to move ahead with drone pilot licensing ?
      1. It appears most people are clueless about licensing drone pilots in India like no licensing for < 25kg in EASA, and an online test in FAA but in India the process is very complex.
      2. Basic vs Advanced  licenses [basic you can do commercial activity], In India we don't have any such categorization.
      3. We have an opportunity to put our perspective and push our ConOps using this licensing issue.
2. ConOps is the place where we should get started to get traction in the community along with working on the UTM.
3. UK UTM [Hrishi presentation]
      1. In US FAA has operational side which is given to NASA but in EU EASA has more nuances to deal with because of multiple countries → they have SESAR to deal with security aspect
      2. Various projects launched in EU in various countries eg: CORUS, GOF- USPACE
      3. Demonstration of air taxi and border police and two ATM ( two countries were involved) → They are using FLARM and ADS-B (services and data flow between them). This was centralized with all tracking sent to an authority.
      4. Issues with these trials were:
         - No possibility of comparing two flight systems because there is no interoperability
         - Drawbacks: No standards developed from these trials
         - ConOps is more about validating use of airspace than technology [Amit]
      5. How to design trials, scenarios and how to validate (next call)
      6. When do we focus on monetization aspect
