## Foreword to Architecture

### State of the art

The following contains a review of existing efforts by different agencies / stakeholders. Some of them have not been updated for a couple of years and we highlight key elements of the the related documents / concepts. 

#### GUTMA

Given that GUTMA is mainly a industry organization and not a authority, they maintain opinions on the architectures for UTM. The main document reviewed is the [UTM Architecture](https://www.gutma.org/docs/Global_UTM_Architecture_V1.pdf) and the [Designing UTM for Global Success](https://gutma.org/designing-utm-for-global-success/) documents. GUTMA recognizes UTM as a "system of systems" with many active and passive stakeholders:

The figure above illustrates the key players in the eco-system and is useful in understanding the scope of a UTM system. In a digital context, all the interactions will happen via APIs since a number of the interactions will be done by computers with little or no human oversight unless there is an emergency.

##### Key Insights from GUTMA Architecture document

- The document identifies roles and use-cases (Pages 17-19, UTM Architecture) which is a good starting point for understanding how these stakeholders will interact with these services.
- The document does not specify technical architectures for UTM and is a good starting point to get a overview of the eco-system. 
- Given that the authors are not in a standards making organization or authority they do not specify or recommend standards that could be adopted. 

#### Swiss ConOps

A [U-Space Concept of Operations for Switzerland](https://www.bazl.admin.ch/bazl/en/home/good-to-know/drohnen/wichtigsten-regeln/uspace.html) was first published in 2019 and updated in 2020. This document, focuses on the specifics and layout a advanced architecture. In Switzerland Skyguide the ANSP works in co-ordination with the Civil Agencies to form the "Common Information Function" (Section 6.1)

##### Key Insights from Swiss ConOps

- The ConOps recognizes two main types of USP services: Vertically integrated and "USP as a service". Both of these talk to a common interoperability framework and exchange data.
![USP-Service-Type](images/usp-types.jpg)
(Source: Swiss ConOps Document, link above)
- The ConOps talks about a incremental framework of approval with selected services and providers in a collaborative fashion by leveraging standards. The incremental process will start with a voluntary stage and after the publication of U-Space rules, technical tools, processes will be explored.
- The Swiss ConOps references the ASTM standard for Network Remote-ID and Tracking and the inter-operability between USSes.

#### European Union Aviation Safety Agency

The EU recently published a legislative framework for U-Space. The regulation details the roles and responsibilities of the different stakeholders in the U-Space / UTM eco-system. The EU through its ConOps has classified operations and airspaces and equipment guidelines for U-Space, a example image is below.

##### U-Space Specifications

- EU works as a federation and it is left to the member states to design the U-Space for drone operations.
- The new U-Space regulation calls for a creation of `U-Space Service Providers (USSP)` that will be certified to provide U-Space services. 
- The EU has identified four mandatory services that must be provided by USSPs:
  - Geo-awareness
  - Traffic Information
  - Flight Authorization
  - Network Identification
- The exist standards for these services e.g. [ED-269](https://eurocae.net/news/posts/2020/june/ed-269-minimum-operational-performance-standard-for-uas-geo-fencing/) for Geo-awareness, [ASTM F3411-19](https://www.astm.org/f3411-19.html) etc. It can be reasonable to assume that these or similar standards will be adopted to by authorities to enable standardized certification.
- Once the implementing regulation comes into force in January 2023, we can assume that there will be activity and interest in this space from the EU.
- Drone operators and ANSPs will have to establish contracts wtih a certified USSP.
